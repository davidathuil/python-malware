 # Python Malware

This Python malware is designed for educational purposes only and should never be used for unethical or illegal activities. The malware consists of several components, including reverse shell, ransomware, and DDoS.

## Features

- **Reverse Shell**: Allows the attacker to gain remote access to the compromised system by connecting back to a predefined server and port.
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts user files and demands a ransom to restore access to them. This feature is included for educational purposes and should never be used for actual ransomware attacks.
- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**: Performs a DDoS attack on a specified target. This feature is included for educational purposes and should never be used for launching DDoS attacks.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Ensure you have enough space and the necessary system resources.
- Clone the source code from the provided repository using:
  ```
  git clone --recursive https://<repository-link>
  ```

### Server

The server component is required for the reverse shell functionality. Set up a server using your preferred platform, such as Metasploit, or develop your own server using Python, Node.js, or any other suitable programming language.

### Client

The client component includes the reverse shell, ransomware, and DDoS functionalities. Follow the instructions below to install and set up the client:

1. Obfuscation process:
   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev \
   libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev \
   xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python3-openssl git
   ```

2. Install `pyenv`:
   ```
   curl https://pyenv.run/ | bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
   pyenv install 3.10.0
   pyenv global 3.10.0
   python --version
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install pyarmor
   ```

4. Obfuscate the Python script:
   ```
   pyarmor gen Desktop/pythonmalware/python-malware/clienttest.py
   ```

## Usage

To use the Python malware, follow the instructions provided in the documentation.

## Next Features

- Keylogger with stealthy exfiltration capabilities.
- Persistence mechanisms to ensure the malware survives reboots.
- Advanced encryption techniques for ransomware to improve resistance against decryption tools.
- Advanced evasion techniques to bypass antivirus and endpoint detection.

Remember, the use of this malware for unethical or illegal activities is strictly prohibited. Use it for educational purposes only, and always follow your local and international laws.
